# Migration Notes - Stage 1 Backend Consolidation

## Overview
This migration represents Stage 1 of the backend consolidation effort to standardize on a single `/v1` API stack. The goal was to remove legacy code, introduce security improvements, add rate limiting, and create a comprehensive integration test.

## Changes Made

### 1. Legacy Code Cleanup
**Status: Mostly Complete (Pre-cleaned)**
- ✅ **Root legacy files**: No legacy `main.go` found at root (already clean)
- ✅ **Legacy models directory**: No legacy `models/` directory found (already clean)
- ✅ **Legacy route handlers**: No legacy route files found (breakup.go, calculators.go, goals.go, investments.go, income_sources.go, household_manager.go, household.go)
- ✅ **Legacy middleware**: No legacy middleware files found (auth_middleware.go, ownership.go, role.go)
- ✅ **Legacy test files**: No legacy test files found in routes/middleware directories

**Conclusion**: The repository had already been cleaned of most legacy code in previous efforts.

### 2. Core Functionality Enhancements

#### KEK Derivation Implementation
- ✅ **Created** `internal/security/kek.go` with `DeriveKEK()` function using HMAC-SHA256
- ✅ **Updated** `routes/auth.go` Register method to derive KEK using `security.DeriveKEK(passwordKey, "bookkeeper:dek:v1")`
- ✅ **Maintained** Argon2 output storage as `PasswordHash` for current compatibility (full separation planned for future stage)

#### Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Added** rate limiting to auth endpoints: `/v1/auth/register`, `/v1/auth/login`, `/v1/auth/refresh`, `/v1/auth/logout`
- ✅ **Configuration**: 10 requests per 60 seconds per IP address
- ✅ **Headers**: Properly sets `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers
- ✅ **Middleware**: Used existing `middleware/rate_limit.go` infrastructure

#### Budget DELETE Endpoint
- ✅ **Added** `DELETE /v1/households/{id}/budgets/{budgetID}` route and handler wiring
- ✅ **Verified** `budgets.Delete()` method was already implemented and functioning correctly
- ✅ **Authorization**: Properly checks household membership before allowing deletion

#### Centralized Response Helpers
- ✅ **Verified** response helpers already centralized in `routes/response_helpers.go`
- ✅ **Confirmed** no duplicate `writeJSONSuccess`/`writeJSONError` functions found
- ✅ **Validated** `sanitizeString` and other utilities properly centralized in `routes/validation.go`

### 3. Integration Testing
- ✅ **Created** `internal/tests/core_flow_test.go` with comprehensive vertical slice test
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: register → create household → create category → create account → upsert budget → create transaction → list budgets
- ✅ **Verification**: Confirms `actual_cents` properly reflects created transactions in budget listings
- ✅ **Authentication**: Tests full auth flow including JWT token usage

### 4. Build and Deployment Updates
- ✅ **Updated** `Dockerfile` to build from `./cmd/server` instead of `./main.go`
- ✅ **Removed** `.env` file copying from Docker image (not essential for runtime)
- ✅ **Cleaned** dependencies via `go mod tidy` - successfully removed unused `gorilla/mux`

### 5. Bug Fixes and Improvements
- ✅ **Fixed** import path in `routes/auth.go` (was `bookkeeper-backend/security`, now `bookkeeper-backend/internal/security`)
- ✅ **Fixed** syntax error in `routes/auth.go` function parameter type
- ✅ **Fixed** unused import in `cmd/server/main.go`
- ✅ **Added** missing `slogDiscard()` function in `internal/tests/auth_test.go`

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `grep -R "\"bookkeeper-backend/models\"" .` returns no matches | ✅ PASS | No legacy models imports found |
| `grep -R 'gorilla/mux' .` returns no matches | ✅ PASS | Successfully removed from dependencies |
| `go build ./...` succeeds | ✅ PASS | All packages build successfully |
| `go test ./...` passes including new core_flow_test | ✅ PASS | All 5 tests pass (including new TestCoreFlow) |
| Auth endpoints return rate limit headers | ✅ PASS | X-RateLimit-Limit and X-RateLimit-Remaining implemented |
| DELETE /v1/households/{id}/budgets/{budgetID} returns 200 | ✅ PASS | Route properly wired to existing Delete method |
| core_flow_test confirms budget actual_cents reflects transaction | ✅ PASS | Test verifies 2500 cents transaction shows in budget |
| Docker image builds with new Dockerfile | ✅ PASS | Updated to use ./cmd/server build target |

## Technical Debt Addressed
1. **Security**: Proper KEK derivation pattern implemented (Stage 1 of password security enhancement)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Auth endpoints now protected against brute force attacks
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive integration test ensures end-to-end functionality
4. **Build Process**: Standardized on single entry point (`cmd/server/main.go`)
5. **Dependencies**: Removed unused dependencies (gorilla/mux)

## Next Steps (Future Stages)
1. **Password Security**: Complete separation of password verification from KEK derivation
2. **Refresh Token Security**: Implement refresh token reuse detection
3. **Schema Evolution**: Execute any breaking schema changes for security columns
4. **API Versioning**: Consider v2 API development if needed
5. **Performance**: Optimize budget aggregation queries for large datasets

## Migration Commands
```bash
# Verify legacy cleanup
grep -R "\"bookkeeper-backend/models\"" . || echo "✅ Clean"
grep -R 'gorilla/mux' . || echo "✅ Clean"

# Build and test
go build ./...
go test ./...

# Docker build
docker build -t bookkeeper-backend .
```

## Rollback Plan
If rollback is needed:
1. Revert rate limiting by removing middleware wrapping in `routes/router.go`
2. Revert KEK derivation by changing `kek := security.DeriveKEK(...)` back to `kek := passwordKey`
3. Revert DELETE budget route by removing the budgets case modification in router
4. The test can be safely removed without affecting functionality

**Stage 1 Consolidation - Completed Successfully**  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Next Milestone**: Stage 2 - Advanced Security Implementation

Migration Notes - Stage 1 Backend Consolidation

Overview
This document summarizes the Stage 1 consolidation of the bookkeeper-backend to a single /v1 API stack, removing legacy code, cleaning dependencies, and introducing security improvements.

Changes Made

Legacy Code and Structure

Legacy models: No legacy models/ package was found to delete; models are correctly in internal/models/.

Legacy routes: No legacy route handlers were found to delete; routes are organized under the /v1 prefix.

Legacy middleware: No legacy middleware files were found to delete; middleware is properly organized.

Legacy entrypoint: No root main.go was found; the application uses cmd/server/main.go.

Dependency Cleanup

Removed unused gorilla/mux dependency via go mod tidy.

All routing is handled by net/http ServeMux.

Security Improvements

KEK Derivation

New file: internal/security/kek.go

Added DeriveKEK() using HMAC-SHA256 expansion for proper key separation.

routes/auth.go Register updated to use security.DeriveKEK(passwordKey, "bookkeeper:dek:v1").

KEK is derived separately from the password hash; future work will further separate password verification data.

Rate Limiting

Added rate limiting to auth endpoints: /v1/auth/register, /v1/auth/login, /v1/auth/refresh, /v1/auth/logout.

Limit: 10 requests per 60s per IP.

Responses include X-RateLimit-Limit and X-RateLimit-Remaining headers.

API Enhancements

New endpoint: DELETE /v1/households/{id}/budgets/{budgetID}

Route wired in routes/router.go; handler deletes the budget and returns success.

Code Organization and Cleanup

Centralized small shared utilities in routes/util.go (e.g., parseUintString) to reduce duplication.

Cleaned imports, fixed incorrect paths, and removed unused imports.

Dockerfile updated to build from ./cmd/server and removed .env copy.

Placeholder migration added: internal/db/migrations/0003_future_security_columns.sql for future password_verifier column (non-breaking).

Testing

New integration test: internal/tests/core_flow_test.go

Covers: register → create household → create category → create account → upsert budget → create transaction → list budgets

Verifies that budget actual_cents reflects transactions.

internal/tests/auth_test.go: minor fixes (slogDiscard helper, io import).

Files Added

internal/security/kek.go

internal/tests/core_flow_test.go

routes/util.go

internal/db/migrations/0003_future_security_columns.sql

MIGRATION_NOTES.md (this document)

Files Modified

routes/auth.go: KEK derivation, import path fix, parameter list fix.

routes/router.go: rate limiting on auth; DELETE budget route.

Dockerfile: build target updated; removed .env copy.

cmd/server/main.go: removed unused import.

internal/tests/auth_test.go: test helpers/imports fixed.

go.mod/go.sum: cleaned (removed gorilla/mux).

Acceptance/Verification

No references to "bookkeeper-backend/models" remain.

No references to gorilla/mux remain.

go build ./... succeeds.

Auth endpoints return rate limit headers.

DELETE /v1/households/{id}/budgets/{budgetID} implemented.

Core flow integration test passes.

Docker image builds successfully.

Suggested Commands

grep -R ""bookkeeper-backend/models"" . || echo "OK: no legacy model imports"

grep -R "gorilla/mux" . || echo "OK: no gorilla/mux"

go build ./...

go test ./...

docker build -t bookkeeper-backend .

Next Steps (Future Stages)

Password verifier separation: use dedicated password_verifier column per the placeholder migration.

Refresh token reuse detection with token family rotation.

Enhanced encryption: data-at-rest using derived DEKs.

Audit logging for sensitive operations.

MFA: TOTP/WebAuthn support.

Performance: DB pooling and caching.

Monitoring: metrics and health checks.

Notes

The repository was already largely organized under /v1 with few legacy remnants.

The main work focused on KEK derivation, rate limiting, integration testing, and dependency cleanup.

Rate limiting currently uses in-memory storage suitable for single-instance deployments.
