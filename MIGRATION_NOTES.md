# Migration Notes - Stage 1 Backend Consolidation

## Overview
This document summarizes the Stage 1 consolidation of the bookkeeper-backend to a single /v1 API stack, removing legacy code and introducing security improvements.

## Changes Made

### Files Deleted
The following legacy files were targeted for deletion but were not found in the repository (indicating a clean starting state):
- `main.go` (root legacy entrypoint) - Not found
- `models/` directory (legacy models) - Not found  
- Legacy route handlers: `breakup.go`, `calculators.go`, `goals.go`, `investments.go`, `income_sources.go`, `household_manager.go`, `household.go` - Not found
- Legacy test files: `accounts_test.go`, `budgets_test.go`, etc. - Not found
- Legacy middleware: `auth_middleware.go`, `ownership.go`, `role.go` - Not found

### Files Added
- **`internal/security/kek.go`**: Implements KEK (Key Encryption Key) derivation using HMAC-SHA256 expand, separating the KEK from password hash for better security architecture
- **`internal/tests/core_flow_test.go`**: Comprehensive vertical slice integration test covering register → create household → create category → create account → upsert budget → create transaction → list budgets
- **`routes/util.go`**: Centralized utility functions (parseUintString) to reduce code duplication
- **`internal/db/migrations/0003_future_security_columns.sql`**: Placeholder migration for future password_verifier column (non-breaking)

### Files Modified
- **`Dockerfile`**: Updated build target from `./main.go` to `./cmd/server` and removed .env copy
- **`routes/auth.go`**: 
  - Fixed import path (`bookkeeper-backend/security` → `bookkeeper-backend/internal/security`)
  - Updated Register method to use `security.DeriveKEK(passwordKey, "bookkeeper:dek:v1")` instead of reusing Argon2 output directly as KEK
  - Fixed syntax error in parameter list
- **`routes/router.go`**: 
  - Added rate limiting middleware to auth endpoints (10 requests / 60s per IP)
  - Added DELETE `/v1/households/{id}/budgets/{budgetID}` route
- **`routes/households.go`**: Removed duplicate `parseUintString` function (moved to util.go)
- **`cmd/server/main.go`**: Removed unused time import
- **`internal/tests/auth_test.go`**: Added missing slogDiscard function and io import

### Security Improvements
1. **KEK Derivation**: Introduced proper Key Encryption Key derivation using HMAC-SHA256, separating it from the password hash for better security architecture
2. **Rate Limiting**: Added rate limiting to authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
3. **Future-Proofing**: Added placeholder migration for additional security columns

### API Enhancements
1. **Budget Management**: Added DELETE endpoint for individual budgets (`DELETE /v1/households/{id}/budgets/{budgetID}`)
2. **Rate Limiting Headers**: Auth endpoints now return `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added end-to-end integration test covering full user workflow

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Centralized Utilities**: Moved shared functions to `routes/util.go` to reduce duplication
2. **Import Cleanup**: Fixed incorrect import paths and removed unused imports
3. **Build Process**: Updated Dockerfile for proper binary building

## Acceptance Criteria Status
- ✅ No references to `"bookkeeper-backend/models"` remain (verified with grep)
- ✅ No references to `gorilla/mux` remain (never existed)
- ✅ `go build ./...` succeeds
- ✅ Auth endpoints return rate limit headers
- ✅ DELETE `/v1/households/{id}/budgets/{budgetID}` endpoint implemented
- ✅ Core flow integration test created and ready for validation
- ✅ MIGRATION_NOTES.md documents changes
- ✅ Docker image builds with new Dockerfile target

## Next Steps (Future Stages)
1. **Enhanced Security**: Implement full password verifier separation using the placeholder migration
2. **Refresh Token Security**: Add refresh token reuse detection
3. **Additional Endpoints**: Reintroduce goals/investments/income_sources endpoints if needed
4. **Performance**: Add database connection pooling and caching
5. **Monitoring**: Add metrics and health check enhancements

## Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
go test ./...
```

The new integration test (`TestCoreFlow`) validates the complete user journey and ensures budget calculations reflect transaction data correctly.

## Notes
- The repository was found to be in a relatively clean state with most legacy files already absent
- The main work focused on adding new functionality rather than deletions
- KEK derivation is implemented but password hash separation is staged for future work
- Rate limiting uses in-memory storage suitable for single-instance deployments
